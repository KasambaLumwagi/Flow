## Detailed Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Spark Cluster and Airflow on Docker

- **Objective**: Deploy Apache Spark and Apache Airflow using Docker containers.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     cd <project_directory>
     ```
  2. Build and run the Docker containers using Docker Compose.
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
  3. Access the Airflow web UI to monitor DAGs and manage workflows.

### 2. Creating Spark Jobs with Python

- **Objective**: Write and submit a basic Spark job using Python (PySpark).
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to the `jobs/python/` directory.
  2. Write a PySpark job that performs a simple transformation, such as word count, on a dataset.
  3. Submit the job to the Spark cluster through Airflow or directly using the Spark CLI.
  4. Monitor the job execution via the Spark UI.

### 3. Creating Spark Jobs with Scala

- **Objective**: Develop Spark jobs using Scala, the native language of Apache Spark.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to the `jobs/scala/` directory.
  2. Create a new Scala project using sbt (Scala Build Tool).
  3. Write and compile a Scala Spark job that performs a transformation such as data aggregation.
  4. Package the job into a JAR file and submit it to the Spark cluster.

### 4. Building and Compiling Scala Jobs

- **Objective**: Learn to compile and package Scala Spark jobs for deployment.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Configure sbt with the necessary dependencies in the `build.sbt` file.
  2. Use sbt commands to build the project and generate the JAR file.
     ```bash
     sbt clean package
     ```
  3. Submit the JAR file to the Spark cluster and monitor execution.

### 5. Creating Spark Jobs with Java

- **Objective**: Write Spark jobs in Java and submit them to the Spark cluster.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to the `jobs/java/` directory.
  2. Create a Maven project and add Spark dependencies.
  3. Write a Spark job in Java that performs operations like data filtering.
  4. Build the project using Maven and generate the JAR file.
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```
  5. Submit the JAR to the Spark cluster.

### 6. Building and Compiling Java Jobs

- **Objective**: Compile and deploy Java-based Spark jobs.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Ensure Maven is correctly configured with all necessary dependencies in `pom.xml`.
  2. Use Maven to build the project and produce a deployable JAR file.
  3. Submit the JAR to the Spark cluster, and analyze job performance through the Spark UI.

### 7. Analyzing Cluster Computation Results

- **Objective**: View and interpret the results from the Spark jobs.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Access the Spark UI to view detailed metrics for each job, including execution time, resource usage, and data processed.
  2. Compare the performance of jobs written in Python, Scala, and Java.
  3. Document the results and consider optimization techniques for improving job performance.
